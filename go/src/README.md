This is a placeholder to retain the skeleton of a functional `$GOPATH`

If starting from scratch, you'll need to also:
1. Download and install golang (https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Ensure that `$GOPATH` is set to the root of this directory, such as:
    `GOPATH=${HOME}/repos/go`
3. Ensure `$GOROOT` is set correctly (safe default: `/usr/local/go/bin`)
