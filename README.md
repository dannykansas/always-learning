# The Learning Repo

Ongoing education on various computer science-y things.

## Primary Goal: 
To avoid the sad state of creating a dozen repos every year on new languages and projects, knowing that only 25% of them will ever have more than a few commits.

This is a functional playground, and any serious work gets to graduate to it's own repo

## Secondary Goal:
To hold my dotfiles ;)
